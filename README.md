## What is CELO?

**Celo** is a decentralized, open-source blockchain network that aims to provide people all over the world with accessible and secure financial tools. Because it is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and is compatible with the Ethereum network, developers can use the same smart contract code on both Celo and Ethereum.

The Celo blockchain's primary goal is to create a more inclusive financial system by making financial services available to anyone with a smartphone. The platform's goal is to lower the barriers to entry for individuals and small businesses seeking financial services such as remittances, microlending, and savings while maintaining the highest level of security and transparency.

Celo's approach to inclusivity includes various design elements that set it apart from other blockchain networks. For example, it uses a unique phone-based identity system to help individuals without traditional forms of identification to access financial services. It also employs a stablecoin, the Celo Dollar (cUSD), to provide a stable store of value and facilitate low-cost transactions across the platform.

Celo employs a **proof-of-stake** consensus mechanism, allowing users to participate in block validation by securing their cUSD or Celo Gold (cGLD) tokens as collateral. This mechanism ensures that validators have a vested interest in the network's success and that transactions can be processed efficiently and securely.

Overall, the Celo blockchain is intended to provide people all over the world with accessible, secure, and transparent financial services. Its use of mobile-first development, a stablecoin, and a unique identity system all help it to achieve its goal of creating a more inclusive financial system. Its compatibility with the Ethereum network, use of proof-of-stake consensus, and emphasis on security and transparency make it an appealing option for both developers and users.


## What is Celo SDK?

The **Celo SDK** (Software Development Kit) is a collection of developer tools designed to assist developers in creating and integrating financial applications on the Celo blockchain. The SDK includes a comprehensive set of tools and resources that enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that interact with the Celo blockchain and give users access to a variety of financial services. The Celo SDK is intended to make it simple for developers to create and deploy smart contracts on the Celo blockchain. The SDK comes with a collection of pre-built contracts that can be used as templates or customized to fit specific use cases. Stablecoins, lending protocols, and decentralized exchanges can all be created using these contracts.

The SDK also includes a set of development tools that make it simple for developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts. These tools include a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Celo blockchain, a testing framework for testing smart contracts, and an integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and debugging smart contracts.

In addition to smart contract development tools, the Celo SDK includes a set of APIs that developers can use to integrate their applications with the Celo blockchain. These APIs enable developers to access blockchain data such as transaction history and account balances, as well as interact with smart contracts on the blockchain.

The Celo SDK's emphasis on mobile-first development is one of its distinguishing features. Developers can use the SDK's mobile wallet to integrate financial services directly into their mobile applications. This enables developers to create dApps that are accessible to anyone with a smartphone, increasing the accessibility of financial services to people all over the world.

The Celo SDK also includes a collection of tools and resources to assist developers in developing and deploying decentralized applications on the Celo network. Documentation, sample code, and a developer community where developers can share knowledge and collaborate on projects are among the resources available.

Overall, the **Celo SDK** is a powerful set of tools that gives developers everything they need to build and deploy financial applications on the Celo blockchain. Its emphasis on mobile-first development, comprehensive set of development tools and resources, and pre-built smart contracts make it an excellent choice for developers looking to create decentralized financial applications on the Celo network.

Now that you've learned what **Celo** and **Celo SDK** is all about here's a tutorial on how to integrate the Celo with a mobile application using the **Celo Wallet SDK**

# Part 1: Setting up the Celo Wallet SDK
  
  The Celo Wallet SDK is a set of tools for easily integrating the Celo blockchain into your mobile application. In this section, we'll go over how to install the Celo Wallet SDK and connect it to your mobile application.

### Step 1: Install the Celo Wallet SDK

Installing the **Celo Wallet SDK** is the first step in integrating Celo with your mobile application. The SDK is available on NPM as a package that can be installed with the following command:

`npm install @celo/walletkit`

### Step 2: Connect to the Celo Network

Once you've installed the Celo Wallet SDK, you'll need to connect to the Celo network. This can be done using the following code:

``` javascript
import { CeloWallet } from '@celo/walletkit';

const celoWallet = new CeloWallet();
celoWallet.connect();
```
This code creates a new CeloWallet instance and connects it to the Celo network.

### Step 3: Authenticate the User

The user will need to authenticate their identity using the Celo Wallet SDK before they can interact with the Celo network via your mobile application. This can be accomplished with the following code:

```javascript
const auth = await celoWallet.authenticate();
console.log(auth);
```
This code opens the Celo Wallet app and prompts the user to authenticate their identity. Once the user has authenticated, the code logs an authentication object to the console.

# Part 2: Interacting with the Celo Network

After you've installed the Celo Wallet SDK and authenticated the user, you can begin interacting with the Celo network via your mobile application. In this section, we'll go over some examples of how to use the Celo Wallet SDK to send transactions, check account balances, and more.

### Sending Transactions

To send a transaction on the Celo network, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const recipientAddress = '<recipient address>';
const amountToSend = 1; // cGLD

const txObject = {
  from: celoWallet.address,
  to: recipientAddress,
  value: celoWallet.web3.utils.toWei(amountToSend.toString(), 'ether'),
};

const txHash = await celoWallet.sendTransaction(txObject);
console.log(txHash);
```
This code sends 1 (one) cGLD to the specified recipient address while also logging the transaction hash to the console.

### Checking Account Balances

To check the balance of your Celo account, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const balance = await celoWallet.getBalance();
console.log(balance);
```
This code retrieves your Celo account balance and logs it to the console.

### Reading Smart Contract Data

To read data from a Celo network smart contract, use the following code:

```javascript
import { ContractKit } from '@celo/contractkit';

const kit = ContractKit.newKit('https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org');
const contractAddress = '<contract address>';
const contract = new kit.web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);

const result = await contract.methods.<method name>(<arguments>).call();
console.log(result);
```
This code creates a new instance of the ContractKit class and retrieves data from the specified smart contract using the contract's ABI and address.
